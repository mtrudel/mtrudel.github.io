Up on the plate today: the importance of thinking, problem reduction, and generalisation, as illustrated through tactical examples. Case in point: it really bugs me when people that oughta know better write stuff that looks like

	if (a == true)
	  if (b == true)
	    return false
	  else if (b == false)
	    return true
	  end
	else if (a == false)
	  if (b == true)
	    return true
	  else if (b == false)
	    return false
	  end
	end

Up front, don't laugh. I see crap like this all the time. 

For those that may not see it, this is exactly equivalent to "a XOR b", and so could be equally expressed as

	return a ^ b

Or, if your language of choice doesn't have XOR:

	return a != b

I'm gonna go out on a limb and suggest that that code should never have been written. Any developer worth their salt should have seen that reduction right off the bat.

To paraphrase the always insightful [Ezra Zygmuntowicz](http://brainspl.at/), "**No code is better than no code**". I'm hereby christening this phrase as "_Ezra's Law_", and will publicly state that anyone I find not following it in our committed code will be flogged, or at least made to buy me a beer.

(Note: feel free to substitute faster / more correct / more maintainable / clearer for better)
