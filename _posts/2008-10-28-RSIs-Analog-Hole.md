title: RSI's Analog Hole
---

**A thought:** Conventional wisdom (somewhat incorrectly, according to the literature) dictates that RSI and carpal tunnel syndrome can be prevented by, among other things, frequent breaks while typing. Most guides suggest breaks of at least 1 minute every 20-60 minutes.

**An observation:** LP records are - on average - about 25 minutes per side.

**A conclusion:** Developers should have turntables at their desks.

**A footnote:** Other benefits include listening to better music, an opportunity to socialize, swap tunes, analog gear to tinker with, etc.
