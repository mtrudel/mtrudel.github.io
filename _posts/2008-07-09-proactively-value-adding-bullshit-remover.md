Wherein I lay out a manifesto I've been working on for a few months.

# A Developer's Articles of Faith

 * The computer is never wrong. If something is amiss, it's because you caused it to be so. Seek understanding through iterative simplification, and rigorous delineation of scope. **DO ONLY WHAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IN ONE SITTING, IN ONE SITTING**
 * When in doubt, your computer is better at a given, well defined, repeatable task than you are. Embrace repeatability, consistency, and automation in your tooling and testing. **CLEANLINESS IS NEXT TO GODLINESS**
 * The marginal cost of CPU cycles is zero. The marginal cost of a developer's time and sanity is quite a bit more. Err on the side of making your life easier at the expense of the computer's. **UNDERSTAND COMPUTERS, BUT DESIGN FOR PEOPLE** (corollary: **PREMATURE OPTIMIZATION IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL**)
 * _If you know what you're doing_, you will probably never understand what you're doing right now better than you do right now. The cognitive context lost when you come back to a task at a later date is large, and can easily turn into your deepest effort drain. Where possible, leave your work at a natural conclusion, with as many low level ends tied up as possible. Where loose ends exist, track them mercilessly. **LOOSE ENDS, LEFT UNADDRESSED, WILL SINK YOU**
 * The counter-case: if you don't know what you're doing right now, give yourself time (or seek out help) to let the context sink in; nobody fires on all cylinders all the time. An important decision made early and wrongly is usuallyÂ _vastly_ more expensive than one made late but correctly (within reason, of course). **IT'S OK (HEALTHY, EVEN) TO BE BEATEN, BUT ONLY IF YOU ADMIT IT**

## Organizational Maxims (an addendum)

 * Give developers the tools and environment they need. If anything; IT, HR, your office layout etc, aren't helping, then they're a liability. Full stop.
**A GREAT WORK ENVIRONMENT MAY NOT LEAD TO TEH AWESOME, BUT A SHITTY ONE WILL CERTAINLY LEAD TO FAILURE**
 * Accept that you'll be wrong a good portion of the time, and build your processes around that. Shamelessly solicit feedback from the bottom to the top; make nobody too ashamed or scared to say anything to anyone (aside: if your people aren't willing to step up to that, you've got the wrong people).
**DO NOT STRATEGIZE / LEAD / DECIDE IN A BUBBLE** (secondary lesson: **EXPECT HINDSIGHT TO KICK YOUR ASS**)
 * Do not tolerate the thin end of the wedge. Good developers are fickle beasts, and have an exceedingly low tolerance for anything that isn't on their terms (aside: if your people roll over and take obvious crap, then &ndash; again &ndash; you've got the wrong people). **BULLSHIT IS THE KRYPTONITE OF GETTING COOL THINGS DONE**
