For those of us who may like to pretend that the buildings of the past are best buried in the name of progress, may I present a memory burned into my brain forever:

I never realized that the building housing the [Tate Modern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankside_Power_Station) came as close as it did to being lost. I think I speak for everyone who has ever stood in awed and humble reverence of the Turbine Hall when I say that I'm glad the axe never fell.
