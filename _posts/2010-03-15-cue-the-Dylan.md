Once in a blue moon, something will come along that just screams out to you a truth you've long known, the tangible metaphor making it all the more real.

and it hit me; I'm writing software for the entire world. Barely fifty years ago, 'no ticky, no laundry' was considered to be a benign and appropriate form of humour (though [some people](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080128145737AAi4Lsy)  apparently have yet to get the memo). Today my work isn't complete unless I take into account a country I've never even been to.

The times really are a changin'. What a wonderful time to be alive.
