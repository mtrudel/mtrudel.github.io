title: Today's dterm trick
---
From any application with context tied to the filesystem, open [DTerm](http://www.decimus.net/dterm.php) and run `open .` to get a Finder window focused on that content. Easy peasy 50/50 shell / GUI magic.  Who needs quicksilver with a context aware terminal lying around?
