[Until this moment](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/12/20/101220fa_fact_paumgarten), it had never occurred to me that Donkey Kong was indeed **Donkey** Kong. I'd honestly never actually seen the word donkey there, instead always assuming it was just a random jibberish name given to the bad guy.

Oops.
